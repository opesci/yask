           This function adds an arc in the data-dependency graph `from` one
           equation (node) `to` another one,
           indicating that the `from` equation depends on the `to` equation.
           In other words, the `to` expression must be evaluated _before_
           the `from` equation.
           In compiler-theory terms, this is a _flow_ dependency, also
           known as a _true_ or _read-after-write_ (RAW) dependency.
           (Strictly speaking, however, equations in the YASK compiler
           are declarative instead of imperative, so they describe
           equalities rather than assignments with reads and writes.
           On the other hand, a C++ function created to implement
           one or more equations will perform analogous reads and writes.)

           Additional considerations:

           - It is not necessary to connect all the equations into a single
           graph.  For example, if **A** depends on **B** and **C** depends
           on **D**, there will be two disconnected subgraphs.  In this
           example, the YASK kernel is free to 1) schedule the functions created for
           **B** and **D** to run together in parallel followed by those for
           **A** and **C** together in parallel, 2) run a single
           function that implements both **B** and **D** simultaneously
           followed by a single
           function that implements both **A** and **C** simultaneously,
           or 3) a combination of the implementations.

           - Only _immediate_ dependencies should be added.
           In other words, each subgraph created should be a transitive reduction.
           For example, if **A** depends on **B** and **B** depends on **C**,
           it is not necessary to add the transitive dependence from **A** to **C**.

           - Only dependencies at a given step-index value should
           be added.
           For example, given
           equation **A**: `A(t+1, x) EQUALS B(t+1, x) + 5` and
           equation **B**: `B(t+1, x) EQUALS A(t, x) / 2`,
           **A** depends on **B** at some value of the step-index `t`.
           That dependency should be added if the automatic checker is disabled.
           (It is true that the next value of `B(t+2)` depends on `A(t+1)`,
           but such inter-step -- analgous to loop-carried --
           dependencies should _not_ be added with this function.)

           - The dependencies should create one or more directed
           acyclic graphs (DAGs).
           If a cycle is created, the YASK compiler
           will throw an exception containing an error message
           about a circular dependency. This exception may not be
           thrown until format() is called.

           - If using scratch grids, dependencies among scratch grids
           and between scratch-grid equations and non-scratch-grid
           equations should also be added. Each scratch grid equation
           should ultimately depend on non-scratch-grid values.

           - This function can be used in cooperation with or instead of
           the built-in automatic dependency checker.
           When used in cooperation with the built-in checker,
           both dependencies from this function and the built-in checker
           will be considered.
           When the built-in checker is diabled via
           `set_dependency_checker_enabled(false)`, only dependencies
           from this function will be considered.
           In this case, it is imperative that all immediate
           dependencies are added.
           If the dependency graph is incomplete, the resulting generated
           stencil code will contain illegal race conditions,
           and it will most likely produce incorrect results.
