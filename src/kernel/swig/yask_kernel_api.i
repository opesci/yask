///////// API for the YASK stencil kernel. ////////////

// This file uses SWIG markup for API generation.

// From http://www.swig.org/Doc4.0/SWIG.html#SWIG_nn2: Everything in the %{
// ... %} block is simply copied verbatim to the resulting wrapper file
// created by SWIG. This section is almost always used to include header
// files and other declarations that are required to make the generated
// wrapper code compile. It is important to emphasize that just because you
// include a declaration in a SWIG input file, that declaration does not
// automatically appear in the generated wrapper code---therefore you need
// to make sure you include the proper header files in the %{ ... %}
// section. It should be noted that the text enclosed in %{ ... %} is not
// parsed or interpreted by SWIG.
